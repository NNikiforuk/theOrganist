## Why did I make this weird app?
I used to work as an organist for ~1,5 years. Then I lost my passion for a while. Now I feel like it's coming back. This app will help me to plan what to play and sing during the ceremonies. There are a few databases for such songs, but in this app there are my favourites


  
## How To Use
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
